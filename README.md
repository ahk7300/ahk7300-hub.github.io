### PROJECTS

---
#### RAG-based LLM for Medical Dialogue Generation – Biomedical NLP [GitHub](https://github.com/advaitpai/Medical-Dialog-Generation)

- Created a healthcare chatbot on GCP that provides contextually relevant responses to medical queries using NLP, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and GPT-3 on PyTorch.
- Enhanced response accuracy by 45% by quantifying RAG's effectiveness using pre-trained BERT embedded tokens.
- Minimized inherent hallucinations to a 2% response rate through fine-tuning and prompt engineering techniques.

#### Algorithmic Fairness & Uncertainty Analysis  [GitHub](https://github.com/zohairhashmi/uncertainty-quantification)

- Developed techniques to quantify uncertainty and enhance fairness in ML models, addressing biases in datasets.
- Analyzed aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties using Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) with PyMC and TensorFlow.
- Improved predictive capability and fairness by 15% and reduced bias by 10% through Ensemble and Dropout Neural Networks.
- Showed that epistemic uncertainty decreases with increased dataset knowledge and demonstrated how adding random noise can reduce biases, resulting in a fairer dataset.
